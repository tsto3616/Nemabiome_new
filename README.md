# Nemabiome_new
Nemabiome validation study, comparing cut offs for reads, primers, pooling methods 

The fastaq files can be found in this link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/hcj3uy5wrzjnkxlhcj8o5/h?dl=0&rlkey=5vblghon690x9ghp34o93xofs NOTE: must check if that link contains all files as I have run out of space on it despite deleting other folders. NOTE: reference sequences available in Usyd_as_ref

Data was processed in the DADA2 pipeline in the Nemabiome_DADA2.Rmd file 

Then analysed the bioinformatic pooling in the bioinformatic pooling branch.
