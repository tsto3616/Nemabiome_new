Bioinformatically pooled whereby we compared Bioinformatic pooling of one replicate (all replicates added, with no extra processing). 2 replicate pooling is when all replicates are added and the data is removed if only 1 replicate detected the species/ ASV. Data that is removed is replaced with a zero. 3 replicate pooling is when all replicates are added and the data is removed if only 1 or 2 replicates detected the species/ASV. Data that is removed is replaced with a zero
