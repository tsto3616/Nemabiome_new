# Nemabiome_new
Herein we bioinformatically pooled the samples, and compared the thresholds (all, 0.05%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%) with the cow, primer and pooling methods. We did this entirely through percentages to keep everything standardised as otherwise the abundance will be subject to differences in the read number due to the bioinformatic pooling. The cut off file sets the cut offs, while the other R file described the analysis using the excel files provided.
